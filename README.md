The unit will include studio visits, guest lectures and seminars to explore London’s diverse and vibrant digital sector. 

This unit also covers how to understand your own agency within the creative industries and how you might manage a portfolio career and generate new opportunities for yourself with your newfound skills set. These opportunities might for example include, crowdfunding a technology product or developing an app-based digital service.

The aim of this unit is to provide and in depth understanding of both the structure of the creative industries in London and the varied opportunities that exist in what is a diverse sector for people engaged with creative computing.

## Unit Content & Assessment - HAND IN DATE Wed 10/06/2020 by 4pm/ EXTENDED DATE Wed 24/06/2020 by 4pm

**Unit Assessment Summary -  This unit is assessed holistically**  
**Assignment Description (2,000 words essay)**

+ The purpose of this project is to position yourself critically within the landscape of creative computing (theory & practice) & to identify a strategy plan outlining how you will begin to impact in this area.

+ This project is one in which you are required to consider your own position in the world of creative computing. It is a project that demands critical self-reflection of your own interests, skills and expertise based on an in-depth consideration of the work already carried out on the course. You will draw upon a number of sources in doing this. 

+ You will need to produce an essay giving:

1. An introduction to an issue that interests you in the worlds of creativity and creative computing (as we encompass it on the course).

2. A coherent, critical analysis of the arguments from a selection of texts that are relevant to this issue (some can be from the reading list). This section will be your mapping of the theoretical area relating to your issue of interest. 

3. An analysis of the key practitioners (artists, creatives, designers, organisations/companies etc.) that work in this area—examining between three and five examples of practice. This will be your mapping of the practical area relating to your issue of interest.

4.  A concluding section which situates yourself, strategically, within the theoretical and practical areas you have mapped. This is where you describe what your strategy is for entering this area upon leaving university.

+ Your essay should be formatted as follows

1. Title Page, stating: Name, Number from your Student ID, Unit & Project Title, Number ofWords, Date of Submission.

2. Main body, structured as follows:
   + Introduction. Introduce & outline the creative area that interests you. 
   + Literature Review. Critically evaluate the theoretical literature in this area. 
   + Practice Examples. Identify and critically examine the key practitioners in this area: provide between three & five examples of practice.
   + Conclusion. Conclude by locating the possible future strategic opportunities for you as a creative practitioner in the area you’ve mapped by identifying where you might be & what you need to do to get there. 

3. List of images, if used.

4. References, properly formatted.

+ Please remember, that you must reference all your quotations fully &properly, using the Harvard convention (see UAL’s guide: Cite Them Right).

+ Write about the topics discussed in class, projects that inspire you, and the experimentations you will be doing.

+ This is your space to reflect and express yourself. It is your digital sketchbook. Decorate your blog however you choose, use an informal tone, scan your drawings, use memes --- so far as the content is intelligible, organised, and shows critical engagement with content of the module.
